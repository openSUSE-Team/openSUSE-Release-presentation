New openSUSE is out!
--------------------

What next?
~~~~~~~~~~

* unfreeze Factory
* set the roadmap
* start developing 
* freeze it again
* test it
* fix it
* branch it
* fix it some more
* release it

Factory development
-------------------

* never ending inflow of package updates
** staging projects for difficult ones (gcc, automake, ...)
* changing all the time
* breaking all the time

+++<br/>+++

=> it's a lot of work to keep it going

Factory development
-------------------

["graphviz", "factory.png"]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
digraph factory {
  rankdir=LR;
  ranksep=0.5;
  nodesep=1;

  graph [truecolor bgcolor="#ffffff00" fontcolor=white sep="+20"]
  node [ color="white" fontcolor=white]
  edge [ color="white" fontcolor=white]
  A [ label="home project\npackage 'foo'" ]
  Ad [ label="'foo's devel project" ]
  F [ label="openSUSE Factory" ]
  B [ label="branched 'bar' package" ]
  Bd [ label="'bar's devel project" ]

  B -> Bd [ label = "maintainer reviews fix", color=green ];
  Bd -> F [ label = "automatic checks\nreview team", color=green ];
  F -> B [ label = "new 'foo' broke 'bar'", color=red ];
  A -> Ad [ label = "maintainer review" ];
  Ad -> F [ label = "automatic checks\nreview team" ];

  {rank=same; Ad Bd }
  {rank=same; A B }
}
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Feature freeze
--------------

* stop breaking everything everyday
* concentration on testing and fixing

Toolchain Freeze
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* freeze core components, leaf packages can be updated

Stabilization Freeze
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* no new features*, concentrate on fixes
* nothing that breaks something else can't get in

Pre-release Freeze
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* only really important fixes can get in

Feature Highlights
------------------

* list of important new features
** no new features after feature freeze ;-)
* choose important applications
* go through package changelogs
* pickup the most important stuff
* split features into categories
* rewrite it as a text

+++<br/>+++

* lot of work +
=> maintainers help welcome!

Factory testing
---------------

openQA
~~~~~~

* automatic testing
* needs to be verified, reproduced and reported

Manual testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* hardware dependent features like UEFI/SecureBoot
* installation works from DVD/USB

Branch new openSUSE
-------------------

* _openSUSE:Factory_ gets copied to _openSUSE:12.3_
* Factory and new openSUSE start to diverge

Select a Gold Master
--------------------

Set of future release images

* chosen from automatic builds
* no critical ship stopper bugs
* it is installable
* still has even known bugs
** fixed later via updates

Preparing mirrors
-----------------

Update web pages
----------------

Wiki

* Welcome page
* new portal page
* replace old with new
** release notes
** feature highlights
** ...
